<p>A few years ago I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/gr2m/">Gregor</a> posting on Twitter about a trip to explore the East African tech scene.
This was about the time when I started to hear more about the emerging African tech hubs.
Which was surprising to me because until then I was actually pretty ignorant and had no idea what was going on in that part of the world.
My view of Africa was mostly shaped by the general narrative we see in the western news, learn in school and the billboard advertisements of some NGOs.
Prejudices imagining poverty (defined by a low GDP), malaria, safari tours, and everything but booming, creative tech and innovation hubs. :)</p>

<p>So when I heard about Gregor&rsquo;s idea of an AfricaHackTrip I got super excited and wanted to join and learn more about what is going on there. And I am very greateful that I got a chance to become part of the AfricaHackTrip team.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-africahacktrip">What is the AfricaHackTrip?</h3>

<p>The AfricaHackTrip is basically a bunch of developers and designers from Europe exploring the East African tech scene. Before we had been working with people from all over the world, but not yet with hackers from Africa.
We were curious and we changed that.</p>

<p>At the same time we also wanted to share our experiences with our local communities in Europe and kick off a continuous exchange.<br />
Part of that plan was to shot a video and to do interviews to learn from people we met exploring the tech ecosystem of East Africa.</p>

<p><strong>It took us ages to finish the movie but it is finally here! \o/</strong></p>

<p>The trip was already a few years ago and a lot has happened since then as the tech ecosystems have been growing super fast and have gained more attention.
But the topic is very relevant and many still belive the narrative of the Africa of the 80s and 90s. I hope the movie and all the projects that happend and happen related to the AfricaHackTrip help a bit to change that.</p>

<p>The 30 minutes documentary contains material from the barcamps and hackathons in Nairobi, Kampala, Kigali and Dar es Salaam and a lot of interviews with some of the incredible people we met.</p>

<p>You are invited to <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/africahacktrip-movie-night-mozilla-berlin-registration-67029227223">the movie screening on August 5th in Berlin at the Mozilla offices</a> - or if you have a good excuse and can not make it, here you can watch it online:</p>

</div>


<p>We have <a href="https://africahacktrip.org/videos">more clips on the website</a> and here is even more around that topic, partly with material and content from the AfricaHackTrip:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://vimeo.com/83678627">African Webmuses</a> - portraits of women in tech that the AfricaHackTrip team met during the trip</li>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh-mNj9lqI4">Drones, robots, mobile payments - Africa&rsquo;s growing digital business</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The whole trip was self-funded but GitHub (who also <a href="https://github.blog/2013-11-13-an-african-hack-trip/">joined</a>) and Mozilla supported the events and the generous contributions of our patient <a href="https://africahacktrip.org/supporters/">supporters</a> made the movie possible. Thank you so much for your support!!</p>

<p>I also want to mention that this is nothing special and I encourage everybody to do the same and simply go there and learn.
If you&rsquo;re interested in tech or even work remotely you should really consider a trip and work a while from one of the tech hubs there.
( that is assuming you&rsquo;re from Europe or the US&hellip; because we are extremely priviliged to be able to do that as our unfair visa requirements in the EU/US sadly make doing an EuroHackTrip like we did the AfricaHackTrip next to impossible.
Please hear <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVuEchnp7nk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=330">Jasper Grosskurth&rsquo;s interview on that</a>.)</p>

<p>Thank you so much and I am looking forward to your thoughts.</p>

        <p>The Bitcoin lightning network is growing quickly. The lightning network is an exciting second layer protocol on top of the Bitcoin network that allows to send real near-instant payments and is perfectly suited for micro-/nano-transactions. <br></p><p>The tools already work great and make it super easy for developers to integrate with the lightning network. <br></p><p>I’ve lately experimented with it and built a demo to show machine-to-machine API payments. It allows the server to request a payment from the client; the client can automatically pay the invoice to access the resource from the server.<br></p><p>The basic workflow is as follows:</p><ol><li>Client sends a request to the server</li><li>Server response with an invoice</li><li>Client pays and sends a proof to the server</li><li>Server responds with the requested resource</li></ol><p>To make it easy for the developer all this can happen in the background so the payment logic can be abstracted and hidden from the developer. <br></p><p>Here is a small ruby application that exposes an endpoint to convert markdown to pdf but requires the client to pay 100 satoshi (currently 0.44 cent) per request. <br></p><p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/bumi/ln-markdown-to-pdf">code here on GitHub.</a> And I made a short <a href="https://vimeo.com/302338717">video showing how it works</a>: <br></p>

<h3>Introducing rack-lightning</h3>
<p>To make it easy for every ruby developer to add lightning payment requests to any ruby application I've written <a href="https://github.com/bumi/rack-lightning">rack-lightning</a>.</p>
<p>rack-lightning is a <a href="https://rack.github.io/">rack</a> middleware that handles the lightning invoice creation and validation on the server.</p><p>
</p><p>
A full <a href="https://github.com/bumi/rack-lightning#usage">usage example</a> can be found on GitHub, but it is not more than adding one line of rack code: 

</p><pre>
<code>
use Rack::Lightning, { price: 100 } 
</code>
</pre>



<p>Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/bumi/rack-lightning">GitHub page for more information</a>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Introducing lightning faraday middleware</h3>
<p>
And to make it easy on the client side I've written a <a>faraday</a> middleware that handles the payment requests on the client: <a href="https://github.com/bumi/faraday_ln_paywall/">faraday_ln_paywall</a>
</p>

<p>The middleware handles the payment of the invoice. Her is a quick useage example: 
</p><pre>
<code>
# initialize a client
client = Faraday.new(:url =&gt; 'https://lightning-2pdf.herokuapp.com/') do |faraday|
  faraday.use FaradayLnPaywall::Middleware, { max_amount: 100 }
  faraday.adapter  Faraday.default_adapter
end

# use the client to do API calls:
puts client.post("/convert/pdf", "# Hallo Welt").body
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Head over to the <a href="https://github.com/bumi/faraday_ln_paywall/">GitHub repository for more information</a>.</p>

<h3>Similar projects</h3>
<p>A few years back I did something <a href="http://michaelbumann.com/post/141356263577/experimenting-with-bitcoin-machine-to-machine">similar with pure bitcoin</a>.
</p>
<p>
And an exciting project is <a href="https://lightning.ws/">lightning.ws</a> that does something similar in Go

        <p>Halloween nights are scary and you are supposed to do scary things. This year I had a few hours in the hotel and so I've built a ruby wrapper around the <a href="https://github.com/nabijaczleweli/openalias.rs">openalias.rs rust package</a>. That is scary because I have no idea about rust :D</p><p>But fist things first, <b>what is OpenAlias?<br></b><a href="https://openalias.org/">OpenAlias</a> is an open standard for simpler addresses for any crypto currencies.<br>It is a DNS based alias system that allows you to use a domain to lookup a cryptocurrency address. So for example, if your wallets supports it (e.g. Electrum) you can simply send Bitcoin to “michaelbumann.com” instead of my Bitcoin address. <br></p><blockquote><p>
At its most basic, OpenAlias is a TXT DNS record on a FQDN (fully qualified domain name). 
By combining this with DNS-related technologies [it has] created an aliasing standard that is extensible for developers, 
intuitive and familiar for users, and can interoperate with both centralised and decentralised domain systems.

</p></blockquote><p>Find more details on the <a href="https://openalias.org/"><b>OpenAlias.org website</b></a></p><p><b>What did I built?</b>
For rust there is a package that does the DNS lookup and parsing of the OpenAlias entries. But we should have one for any language to make it easy for developers to integrate OpenAlias. That's why I made this <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/openalias">ruby gem</a> that ruby developers can use in their apps and use OpenAlias. <br>
Right now it is using the rust library as a native extension, but at some point I might write a pure ruby one.</p><p><b>Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/bumi/openalias-ruby">bumi/openalias-ruby on GitHub.</a></b><br></p>

        <p>I’ve recently updated and re-installed some of my servers and bitcoin and lightning nodes that I am running. It’s amazing how easy it is to run and operate your own bank and payment service. And I encourage everybody to operate your own bitcoin full-node and lightning node.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though there are plenty of resources out there on how to install everything you need on the various systems, here are a few notes on my setup. -&nbsp; maybe it helps somebody. :)&nbsp;</p><p><b>I am running currently:&nbsp;</b></p><p>* Bitcoin core 0.17.0<br>* lnd 0.5.0-beta <br></p><p>My goal is to have my setup as simple and as default as possible. I am using the default packages where possible and I try to be able to update to latest versions quickly. <br>For parts of the setup I am using some custom ansible scripts which I will not cover here (ansible is rather sooner than later a pain anyway and you should not use it)</p><h3>0. Install basic system packages</h3><p>build-essential, git, unattended-upgrades, vim, zsh,...<br></p><p>make sure to secure your system: ufw, fail2ban, lynis, rkhunter</p><h3>1. Install and configure bitcoind <br></h3><p>The <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node">how-to run a full node</a> on bitcoin.org has all the information you need to install bitcoind. <br></p><p>Basically installing bitcoind from the bitcoin ubuntu packages repository:<br></p><blockquote><p>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin <br>sudo apt-get update<br>sudo apt-get install bitcoind</p></blockquote><p>I am running bitcoind as <i>bitcoin</i> user and have all the bitcoind data and config stored in the <i>bitcoin</i>’s home directory.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>useradd -m bitcoin<br>mkdir /home/bitcoin/bitcoind_data</p></blockquote><p>Adjust your bitcoind configuration. You can use the <a href="https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-core-config-generator/">config file generator</a> by <a href="https://lopp.net/">Jameson Lopp</a>. You also find all the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin">config options in the wiki</a>.<br><br>This is my <a href="https://gist.github.com/bumi/41dba624756a052dd3470e21ee99c7d2">config file - </a>pretty standard, except the bitcoin datadir and the <a href="http://zeromq.org/">zeromq</a> config that we will need later for lnd. <br></p><p>This is the default <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/init/bitcoind.service">bitcoin systemd service configuration</a>. By default it is loading the <i>bitcoin.conf</i> from <i>/etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf. </i>Though I am also storing the config file in the bitcoin dir <i>/home/bitcoin/bitcoind_data </i>which makes it easier for lnd to find it.<br></p><p>Don’t forget to open the bitcoin port; typically 8333 (<i>ufw allow 8333</i>)</p><p>Now you should be able run bitcoind using systemctl&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>sudo systemctl start bitcoind<br>sudo systemctl status bitcoind<br></p></blockquote><p>When you want to see the logs in <i>journalctl -u bitcoind</i> you have to make sure that you are not running bitcoind as a <i>daemon</i>, change the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html#Type=">Type</a> in the of the systemd service from <i>forking</i> to <i>simple</i> and configure the <i>printtoconsole</i> bitcoind option. Otherwise it does print to console and the logs can not be captured. - But you can just look at the debug.log :) <br></p><p>Also note: when you update the bitcoind installation the systemd service and potentially your changes get overwritten.<br></p><h3>2. Install and configure lnd</h3><p>To run lnd you need go 1.10 or better 1.11. I’ve manually <a href="https://golang.org/dl/">downloaded go</a> and extracted it to <i>/</i><i>usr/lib/go-1.11/</i> <br>Make sure to that you have the go binary in your $PATH. I’ve linked the go bin to <i>/usr/local/bin</i>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>sudo ln -s /usr/lib/go-1.11/bin/go /usr/local/bin/go</p></blockquote><p>Also make sure that <i>$GOPATH/bin</i> is in your $PATH for all go installed executables.<br>I’ve added a /<i>etc/profile.d/go.sh</i> with:</p><blockquote><p>export GOPATH=~/go<br>export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin</p></blockquote><p>Once go is working install lnd as described here in the <a href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md#installing-lnd">official installation notes</a>. Make sure to run this from the <i>bitcoin</i> user as we have the default $GOPATH&nbsp; <i>~/go</i> .</p><p>Similar to bitcoind I have LND configured to use <i>/home/bitcoin/lnd_data</i> as main lnd directory. This is my <a href="https://gist.github.com/bumi/c871a0bc082dc9bc9c5d1c19001d9a8d#file-lnd-conf">lnd.conf</a>. <br></p><p>If you want to access your LND node remotely (for example from a mobile app) you need to configure it to rpclisten on a <a href="https://gist.github.com/bumi/c871a0bc082dc9bc9c5d1c19001d9a8d#file-lnd-conf-L5">public interface and the port 10009 (default) must be open.<br></a></p><p>LND needs uses zeromq to read data from bitcoind so make sure you configured <a href="https://gist.github.com/bumi/41dba624756a052dd3470e21ee99c7d2#file-bitcoin-conf-L8">bitcoind with the zeromq config</a> mentioned above.&nbsp;</p><p>And try your lnd setup:</p><blockquote><p>lnd --configfile=/home/bitcoin/lnd_data/lnd.conf</p></blockquote><p>It will tell you to create a wallet using lnci <br></p><blockquote><p>lncli --lnddir=/home/bitcoin/lnd_data create</p></blockquote><p>I use systemd to run lnd as a service. <a href="https://gist.github.com/bumi/c871a0bc082dc9bc9c5d1c19001d9a8d#file-lnd-service">This is my service configuration</a> which goes in <i>/lib/systemd/system/lnd.service </i>(don’t forget to systemctl enable it)<i><br></i>But please note that the wallet needs to be unlocked using the lncli on every start of lnd manually.</p><p><b>That should be it! Your bitcoin and lightning node should be up and running! Now it’s time for the fun part :) <br></b></p><h3>3. Setup your client GUI<br></h3><p>So far I have tried the following lighting apps connected with my LND node:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.lndthinwallet.com/">Union7 iOS wallet - my favorit mobile wallet so far</a><br></li><li><a href="https://www.zap.jackmallers.com/">ZAP iOS </a><br></li><li><a href="https://github.com/LN-Zap/zap-desktop">ZAP Desktop</a> - nice cross-platform Desktop app</li></ul><p>To connect those client to you wallet you will need the tls.cert and the admin.macaroon. These files can be found in the lnd directory:<br></p><p><i>/home/bitcoin/lnd_data/tls.cert</i> and <i>/home/bitcoin/lnd_data/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/admin.macaroon</i></p><p>For ZAP iOS there is <a href="https://github.com/LN-Zap/zapconnect">zapconnect</a> that generates a QR code that can be scanned to configure the mobile client. Union7 has a similar feature <a href="https://www.lndthinwallet.com/">described in the FAQ.</a></p><p>Once connected you can use the client or the lncli to get a new bitcoin address and fund your lightning wallet. <br></p><blockquote><p>lncli --lnddir=/home/bitcoin/lnd_data newaddress p2wkh<br></p></blockquote><p>Now it is time to go shopping! Maybe checkout <a href="https://www.bitrefill.com/">bitrefill,</a> Y’alls or buy some pixels on <a href="https://satoshis.place/">satoshis.place</a><br>All those sites have instructions on how to open channels. Also have a look at explorers like <a href="https://1ml.com/node">1ML</a><a href="https://satoshis.place/"><br></a></p><p>If you have trouble, let me know!&nbsp;</p><p>if this did not help, maybe <a href="https://gist.github.com/bretton/0b22a0503a9eba09df86a23f3d625c13">this write up </a>has the right info for you<br></p>

        <p>I was just chatting with the always inspiring <a href="http://twitter.com/namxam">Max</a> today about <a href="http://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>.I’ve never really used GraphQL in production but I am pretty excited about the flexibility it brings for clients to query data from a server. GraphQL provides a easily understandable description of the data an API provides and gives the client the possibility to query exactly the data it needs in one single request.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently I am not building any APIs but requesting data from <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> smart contracts, <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>, etc. And one of the problems in my opinion is querying data from the different sources which adds quite some complexity and leads to loads of HTTP requests to get all the data. <br></p><p>For example: we store user profiles in a mapping: <br></p><p>mapping(address =&gt; string) public profiles;</p><p>They key is the user’s account address and the value is an IPFS hash containing detailed profile data. <br>To retrieve all profiles (including the data from IPFS) in our dAPP (client side JS) we would need to somehow iterate over the the mapping (which is already hard enough) and then request the profile object from IPFS.</p><p>Quite some code manage the fetching of some rather simple data and I actually don’t like that UI developers have to deal with that. <br></p><p>So the question arose if it is possible to create a GraphQL wrapper for smart contracts, IPFS objects, etc.?<br>Using the smart contract’s ABI and some custom resolvers this should be possible. The same wrapper API could make it easier for different clients and tools be built on top of that.<br></p><p>Now one could say we don’t want the additional server component, but as it is just loading data from the networks and prepares it for the UI I think that’s not a problem and just a useful addition to the dApp architecture.<br>The frontend and this GraphQL server component could still be deployed wherever and no central installation is required. <br></p><p>What do you think? did anyone try GraphQL in that context already?<br></p>

        <p>Nearly two years ago I’ve <a href="https://github.com/bumi/bundler-thankyou">experimented</a> with the idea of using bitcoin payments to tip open source projects. The idea is to analyze the dependencies of a project (by parsing the bundler Gemfile or npm package.json), extract donation information and send a “thank you” to these projects.  <br></p><p>Bitcoin is the perfect protocol for this. We can <a href="http://michaelbumann.com/post/143382258547/online-payments-transfer-value-instead-of">directly transfer value</a> and do not need any intermediary. The projects and users do not have to agree on a service provider (like paypal or patreon), no signup es required. It is implemented on a protocol level and not as a tool/service. <br></p><p>As a demo I had created a small <a href="https://vimeo.com/166398703">video showing the interaction and user flow:</a></p><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="vimeo" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="331" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F166398703"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/166398703?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" title="bundle thankyou" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" width="540" height="331" frameborder="0"></iframe></figure><h3>How does it work?</h3><p>Thanks to the nature of Bitcoin transactions it is possible (and even encouraged) to send one transaction to multiple recipients (outputs).<br></p><p>bundle-thankyou analyzes the dependencies from the package manger file (Gemfile, package.json,...) and gathers the recipient addresses 
from the locally installed gems - thus no need for a central directory 
or similar.<br>
Then we the user is asked how much should be paid and a single transaction is created and published. Done.</p><p>Obviously one could envision any fancy user interface and features to
 do that.</p><h3>What the author needs to do:
</h3><p>The gem author adds a Bitcoin address to the gemspec (in the 
metadata field).<br>That’s all the author has to do.</p><p>Because the address is in the gemspec we can be sure it is the address the author/maintainer wants the money to go to.</p><p>The author could also decide to dedicate the donations to somebody 
else. For example the rails gems could say thankyous should go to 
RailsGirls or similar projects.</p><h3>What the user has to do:</h3><p>Use this tool and basically run bundle thankyou and pay the desired amount. The amount will automatically be split among all the used gems. <br></p><p>With Bitcoin becoming more and more popular it also gets easier for people to start using it. And it would also be possible to create a service on top of this “standard” that allows users to pay with credit cards and handles the bitcoin payments.</p><h3>Advantages</h3><ul><li>No signup whatsover</li><li>User and maintainer do not need to agree on a service (like paypal) to perform the transaction</li><li>No central directories and services</li><li>Based on existing tools (rubygems, npm, etc.)</li><li>Implemented on a "standard/protocol level" - additional service can be built and integrated. (like any existing bitcoin services, subscriptions, etc.)</li><li>Works internationally (not everybody has a credit card or can have a paypal account)</li><li>One transaction for multiple recipients</li><li>Usable in the moment where the user interacts with the gems (in the terminal running a bundle command)</li></ul><h3>Questions:</h3><p><b>Why Bitcoin?</b><br>It is probably the most broadly adopted solution. But any other cryptocurrency would be possible. <br></p><p><b>But I want to pay with credit card (or whatever else)</b><br>Bitcoin is used as a method/"protocol" to transfer value.</p><p>We could provide additional service (for both user and project maintainer separately) to better fit their needs - for example different payment methods, subscriptions, etc. For example card payments could be easily possible with services like Coinbase.</p><p><b>But I want to receive payments on my credit card</b><br>Again Bitcoin is the "protocol". There are already plenty tools out there that for example give you a visa/master card for spending the received bitcoins. Or bank transfers, or m-pesa mobile money payments, or....</p><h3>A comment about money</h3><p>I am very critical about the human perception of the "payment". I do not want it to feel like I've "paid" somebody for something.<br>The tone/message is super important and it should not be "payment" but a way of saying "thank you"... thus <b>bundle thankyou.</b></p>

        <p><p>Earlier this year I’ve been in SE Asia and while visiting Myanmar/Burma my good friend Puneet told me he will visit his mother in India.
