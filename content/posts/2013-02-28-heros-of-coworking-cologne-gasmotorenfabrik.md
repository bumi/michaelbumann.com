title: "Heros of Coworking Cologne / Gasmotorenfabrik"
---
<p>So, as you know our <a href="http://michaelbumann.com/post/43229018566/die-gasmotorenfabrik-cowoco-zieht-um-hello-bottfabrik">coworking space is moving</a>... and we are all very excited about the great new possibilities this offers. Currently everything is still very empty and, ja, it looks like moving... ;) but last week the space already could host the first user groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of seeing how much hard work this is I want to say thanks to some of the heros of Coworking Cologne. Please buy them a beer or two the next time you meet them...</p>
