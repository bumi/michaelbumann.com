title: About me

---
Hey my name is Michael Bumann (you have guessed that, right?).  
I’m a Software Engineer and open web enthusiast.

My current research topics focus on decentralization and [decentralized autonomous organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) as well as financial systems and crypto currencies ([Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/)).

Until 2016 I’ve been working with [Railslove](http://railslove.com) a software consultancy which I have co-founded in 2008 and that grew out of the passion to create sustainable software for innovative web products.

I am also trying to understand our beautiful world a little better and [this is my bucket list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_countries_and_territories) for that.

You can read more details about my past and current work on my [profile](http://profile.michaelbumann.com/)
and find me on [GitHub](http://github.com/bumi/),
