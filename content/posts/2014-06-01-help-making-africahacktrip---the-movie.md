<p>tl;dr: <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/africahacktrip-the-movie/x/1586873">Please support our indiegogo campaign to make the AfricaHackTrip movie. Click here.</a></p>
<p><br />From our <a href="http://africahacktrip.org">tour to explore</a> the vibrant East African tech scene in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania we have collected more than 30 hour of video footage and thousands of pictures. Our goal now is to turn this into a movie - a documentary about East African tech hubs and about what we have found visiting some <a href="http://nairobidevschool.org/">very</a> <a href="http://theoffice.rw/">inspiring</a> <a href="http://www.ihub.co.ke/">places</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our goal is to to share the information and experiences with the communities in Europe and make more people aware of the fast growing tech scene in East Africa. - Something that I was not aware of prior to the trip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To achieve this we need your <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/africahacktrip-the-movie/x/1586873">help</a>! It is a lot of work to go through all the material and turn it in a documentary. And we need to hire someone for cutting the material and the post production. For that we are looking to &nbsp;<a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/africahacktrip-the-movie/x/1586873">raise 7000 USD</a>.&nbsp;</p>
