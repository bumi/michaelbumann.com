title: "Sending Bitcoin to a Kenyan mobile money account using the telegram messenger"
---
<p>
<b>Update:</b> This post was about a technical prototype application that I've developed which allowed you to use bitcoin to send money to an m-pesa mobile money account. I've made a <a href="https://vimeo.com/143249662">demo video about the app here</a>. The demo got great attention and but sadly I had to remove the post and replace it with this clearification. If you have questions, please <a href="mailto:hello@michaelbumann.com">contact me</a>

<p>Update (August 2016): KenyaInsights article: <a href="http://kenyainsights.com/revealed-how-a-worried-safaricom-used-backdoor-to-shutdown-bitcoin-which-was-set-to-neutralize-mpesa-dominance-in-kenya/">"Revealed: How A Worried Safaricom Used Backdoor To Shutdown Bitcoin Which Was Set To Neutralize Mpesa Dominance In Kenya"</a>

<hr><p>You might have seen the demo of a little hack that I have done while visiting Nairobi. The demo shows how it could look like to request money (in my case Bitcoin) through a messenger like whatsapp or telegram and how the m-mesa agents work.
</p><p>
Surprisingly the post got some attention but it seems quite some people have miss interpreted it (or haven't read my blog post at all). That's why I had to decide to remove the post.
</p>
<p>If you have seen the demo you find some more explanation about it here: <a href="http://michaelbumann.com/post/133263086192/some-explanation-about-the-bitcoin-telegram-bot"><i>Some explanation about the Bitcoin-Telegram bot</i></a> - some things that I should have probably emphasised more in the first place...lession learned.
</p><p>
My sole interest was to experiment with possible user experience ideas and integrations. Again: it is <strong>not</strong> a product that is usable now and no currency conversion whatsoever took place. Also in most cases m-pesa is used through a hack from an android phone. Nothing that would work besides from such a demo.
