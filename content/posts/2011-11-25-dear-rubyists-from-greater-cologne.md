title: "Dear Rubyists from greater Cologne! "
---
<p>In November 2005 we've started the first Ruby usergroup in cologne. Back then we've been <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bumi/64761771/">4 people who met for beers</a>. This was nearly exactly 6 years ago.  Unfortunately the meetup has soon become inactive - actually I can not remember when that was and how it happened.</p>&#13;
<p>After that, I guess in 2007 the <a href="http://rurug.de">rurug.de</a> started with greater success. It was a meetup which first took place in the rooms of the <a href="http://koeln.ccc.de">Chaos Computer Club Cologne</a>. Sadly I haven't participated in that meetup very activly :( *bad bumi*</p>&#13;
<p>Early this year the meetup then has moved to <a href="http://cowoco.de">cowoco</a> and renewed itself with about 30+ people attending.  The following events had been awesome! Great talks and even better discussions.  Unfortunatelly, after summer we've became very inactive again. Not many people participated on the mailing list and the event hasn't taken place in the last two months.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>WE NEED TO CHANGE THIS!! </strong></p>&#13;
<p>And now is the time to rethink the meetup.<br />I know we have so many awesome ruby developers here in cologne, working on exciting projects! </p>&#13;
<p>We need to connect, share, teach in our local ruby community! <br /><strong>Let's work together to bring back one of the best tech meetups in Cologne! </strong></p>&#13;
<p>To get this started again I propose the following things:</p>&#13;
<ul><li><strong>changing the mailing list to something that is more accessible. </strong><br /> This is something I've heard several times. The current mailinglist is kinda hard to follow and it's hard for people to get into the conversation. -this is especially the case for new people. <br />I also think the mailing list has some spam issues?!</li>&#13;
<li>maybe using a google group for now. I do not really like google groups but it works for <a href="http://colognejs.de">cologneJS</a>. </li>&#13;
<li><strong>better organizations/archiving of the talk material</strong> like slides etc. - obviously ;)</li>&#13;
<li><strong>inviting more speakers</strong><br /><a href="http://speakerexchange.org/"> speakers exchange</a> is a great. I herby invite <a href="http://twitter.com/joshkalderimis">@joshkalderimis</a> to tell us about <a href="http://travis-ci">travis-ci</a></li>&#13;
<li><strong>meetup for some delicious Glühwein on the christmas market to discuss these things</strong> <br /> Date: 14th Dez. 07:00pm at Heumarkt</li>&#13;
</ul><p>What do you think? How do you feel about the cologne ruby meetup? Who joins me?</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Cologne.rb let's unite! </strong></p>
