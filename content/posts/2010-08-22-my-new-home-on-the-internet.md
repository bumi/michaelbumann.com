title: "my new home on the internet"

<p>I haven't been blogging for quite a while...so yeah, finally this is my new blog. Hosted on tumblr. Expect random stuff about the web, web development, Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, and anything else that comes to my head.</p>&#13;
<p>Actually I'm still looking for a perfect software that provides the tools to publish online.  <br />I'd basicly like to do is some kind of aggregation of stuff I've published somewhere on the web into my blogging stream. Guess one may call that lifestream. ;) But all solutions I've seen do a pretty bad job making sure sure the blog doesn't get spammed. I want to show you my links on delicious. my commits on github, my fotos on flickr, etc. - if it's of interest for you. Yes, tumblr allows importing external sources, which publishes every entry as single post. So importing my github feed would publish one post per commit, but what I actually want to tell is that I've worked on project X. Hope you get the idea. What do you think?</p>&#13;
<p>Anyhow until I find somthing that I really like. This is my new home on the interwebs. </p>
