A few months ago I've built an app for my grandma. More or less the first time my skills have become directly useful for my grandma - so I am pretty happy about that. :)
Our family is spread across many cities and continents and I thought it would be nice if she gets some impressions from her big family more often delivered to her house. 
First my plan was to get her a digital picture frame but she does not have internet and having something physical is still way nicer.</p><p>So I've built an application that allows everyone to send photos and once a certain number of photos is reached the pictures get printed and delivered to her house. Everyone simply sends in photos via e-mail and roughly once a month she gets a package of photos from all over the world. </p><p>Because I like the idea of constantly collecting some photos and getting them printed and send to myself or friends and family I made this application available for everyone: </p><p><b>Meet <a href="http://tasveer.de">tasveer.de</a> </b>- tasveer literally means a picture or a photo in Hindi. (thanks to <a href="http://bharill.com/">Puneet</a> for the name) The app lets you create an album with a custom e-mail address. Simply send photos to that e-mail address and once 25 pictures are collected prints will be delivered to the configured recipients. </p><p>I am using it for myself, collecting photos on the road and getting prints automatically sent home. </p><p>The app is <a href="https://github.com/bumi/kuvakehys">open source</a> and I am planning some more features to make it as easy and seamless as possible. (The interface is currently very basic and rough - anyone wants to join and work on the UI?) </p><p>Prints are currently free because I have not yet implemented any payment options but I’d love to hear what you think. :)<br></p><p>Visit <a href="http://tasveer.de">tasveer.de and create your album.</a></p></p>
