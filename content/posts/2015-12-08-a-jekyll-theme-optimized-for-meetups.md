I did not want to use something like meetup.com just because it is way too much and too complicated.&nbsp;<br>To make it easy to host I wanted to have a static website but with the functionality to RSVP and list the participants.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve ended up forking @<a href="https://twitter.com/brianmaier">brianmaierjr</a>’s great&nbsp;<a href="http://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> theme <a href="https://github.com/brianmaierjr/long-haul">long-haul</a>&nbsp;(as seen on the image above) and added some functionality that was needed for an event page: mainly RSVPs, embeded loaction map, and information about when and where.</p><p>Because jekyll generates a static website the theme uses&nbsp;<a href="http://stamplay.com">stamplay.com</a> as a backend as a service provider to store the event participants.&nbsp;</p><p>Have a look at the source and readme over here:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/bumi/long-haul">https://github.com/bumi/long-haul</a></p><p>To create your own site, simply for the <a href="https://github.com/bumi/long-haul">repository</a>, customize to your needs and deploy it to a static site hoster like <a href="http://pages.github.com">github pages</a>.</p><p>And, hey, if you are in Kigali, stop by at our <a href="https://bumi.github.io/online-payments-meetup-kigali/">meetup</a> next week.</p>
