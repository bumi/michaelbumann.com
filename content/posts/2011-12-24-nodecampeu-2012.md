<p><a href="http://nodecamp.eu">Nodecamp.eu</a> was nothing but an incredible event and I was told that people really enjoyed and loved it. The quality of discussions and talks was just mind-blowing. For me I can also say the best event I've co-organized ;)</p>&#13;

<p>For those who haven't attended: <strong>What is nodecamp.eu?<br /></strong>It's a fully community driven event. No marketing bla bla. focus strictly on content, inspiring and educating talks, great hacking. A product of everyone's <strong>participation.</strong> If you haven't attended, ask someone who has been there. </p>&#13;
<p>Lately more people have asked me about nodecamp.eu in 2012:</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Will there be a <a href="http://nodecamp.eu">nodecamp.eu</a> in 2012??</strong></p>&#13;
<p>To make it short: <strong>YES! we want to have a nodecamp.eu 2012. </strong></p>&#13;
<p>But for 2012 I'd like to propose something... Nodecamp.eu has been about bringing passionate people together, learning and pushing the <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a> community. In 2011 we gathered at <a href="http://cowoco.de">cowoco</a> in Cologne/Germany but this is an european, international event! So Tim and I would like to see nodecamp.eu beeing hosted in another country.</p>&#13;
<p class="huge">We'd like to turn the nodecamp.eu into an yearly event hosted in different countries.</p>&#13;
<p><span class="huge"></span>- somewhat similar to the <a href="http://euruko.org/">Euruko</a>. <strong>It shall become the yearly node.js event organized by the european node.js community. </strong></p>&#13;
<p>Over the next week I will turn nodecamp.eu into the central resource for the event in 2012 and the next years. <strong> </strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>What do you think?<br /></strong>What would you like to the nodecamp 2012 to be? </p>
