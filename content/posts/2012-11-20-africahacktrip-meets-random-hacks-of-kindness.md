<p><a href="http://africahacktrip.org/hackathons"><img align="right" height="99" src="http://cl.ly/image/3P3d2w051i2Y/Screenshot%2011:20:12%2016:05%20.jpeg" width="208" /></a>On December 1st and 2nd the next globale <a href="http://rhok.org">Random Hacks of Kindness</a> hackathon is taking place all over the world. The RHoK is a global initiative to  make "the world a better place by developing practical, open source technology solutions to respond to some of the most complex challenges facing humanity."</p>&#13;
<p>The gloal is to bring people working around development and social issues (local charities, NGO’s, The World Bank, researchers, …) together with people from IT / Technology (software developers, engineers, technical people) and create solutions to create solutions using open technology on subjects that matters.</p>&#13;
<p>In general I believe that many things can greatly be improved with just little (open) technology. And lot of tech and coding stuff is easy these days, we need to make more people excited to see it as tools for simply solving problems. - This is also one reason why I like and support projects like <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Railsgirls</a>.</p>&#13;
<p>I've never had the chance to participate in a RHoK event so I'm really excited. ;)</p>&#13;
<p>With the <a href="http://africahacktrip.org">AfricaHackTrip</a> our goal is to kick of a continuous exchange with tech communities in Africa and that's why we support the RHoK.<br />For the RHoK we plan to work in a global team and to connect the different events. It's the first of some <a href="http://www.africahacktrip.org/hackathons/">hackathons</a> planned for the next year.</p>&#13;
