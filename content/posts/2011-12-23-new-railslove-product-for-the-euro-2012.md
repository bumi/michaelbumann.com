title: "New Railslove product for the EURO 2012"
---
<p>As you might have heard, next year is the <a href="http://de.uefa.com/uefaeuro/index.html">european football (soccer) championship</a> and like for the last worldcup <a href="http://railslove.com">Railslove</a> has an awesome betting community aka Tippspiel in the making. The Tippspiel was a big success at the latest world championship so we've decided to improve it and offer it for the Euro 2012. </p>&#13;
<p><strong>So what is it and who is it for? </strong></p>&#13;
<p>It's a corporate betting community. The branded community app around the Euro 2012. Allowing companies to create their story around the 2-3 month long event. Features include: full customization, user/groups rankings, user 1:1 prediction battles, news and real-time results etc. ;) I don't want to tell to much here, but drop me an email if that sounds interesting for you or someone you know.  </p>&#13;
<p>Here is a preview of our Railslove game. hope you all will join next year: </p>&#13;
