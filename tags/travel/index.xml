      <description>A few years ago I saw Gregor posting on Twitter about a trip to explore the East African tech scene. This was about the time when I started to hear more about the emerging African tech hubs. Which was surprising to me because until then I was actually pretty ignorant and had no idea what was going on in that part of the world. My view of Africa was mostly shaped by the general narrative we see in the western news, learn in school and the billboard advertisements of some NGOs.</description>

      <description>I was looking for the most simple way of tracking the places I’ve visited. (If you ask why... I guess just because...for no real reason :) There are quite some tools out there that track your movements but most of them do that on a too detailed level and also store the location data in their (not my) databases. At the same time I did not want to run and maintain a database myself.</description>
