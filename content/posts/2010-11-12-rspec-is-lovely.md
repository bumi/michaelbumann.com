<p>A few days ago I've visited my friend and fellow railslover @<a href="http://twitter.com/reddavis">reddavis</a> in bath and I was lucky to get a great rspec2 tutorial at the bathcamp (the bath unconference). rspec really has some great features that make writing and maintaining specs a lot more easy and fun. Red has posted some <a href="http://railslove.com/weblog/2010/11/09/rspec-is-lovely/">examples on the railslove blog</a>. So make sure to test <a href="https://github.com/rspec">rspec2</a> and read <a href="http://railslove.com/weblog/2010/11/09/rspec-is-lovely/">red's post</a> </p>&#13;
