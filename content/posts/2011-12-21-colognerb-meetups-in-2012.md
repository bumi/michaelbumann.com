title: "Cologne.rb meetups in 2012"
---
<p>Last week a few rubyists met for some Glühwein and discussed the plans for the ruby meetups here in Cologne next year. These are the results. </p>&#13;
<ul><li><strong>next meetup: 18. Januar 2012</strong></li>&#13;
<li>the <strong>location rotates</strong> and we'll meet in different locations every month.</li>&#13;
<li>we'll setup a new mailing list on google groups which is easier accessible as the current mailing list</li>&#13;
<li>we'll use hack <a href="http://hcking.de/">hcking.de</a> to publish the events and to have an ical feed</li>&#13;
<li>we'll create a new website based on the <a href="http://www.onruby.de/">Hamburg Usergroup</a></li>&#13;
<li>Cologne.rb will be the name thus we'll have colognerb.de and koelschrb.de</li>&#13;
</ul><p>What have I forgotten? See you next year! </p>
