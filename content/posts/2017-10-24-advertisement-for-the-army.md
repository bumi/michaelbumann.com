<p>So here is a question: As far as I know doctors in Germany are <b>not</b> allowed to advertise freely and there are tough regulations on advertisement.... but I have to constantly see that advertisement for the German army that looks more like a first-person shooter video game?!?</p><p>During a games convention in Cologne the whole city was full of video-game like advertisement to join the army and to&nbsp;“do what really counts”... in&nbsp;“Mali”&nbsp;“[saving democracy]” for&nbsp;“our country”...</p><p>Wouldn’t it be nice if doctors are also allowed to freely advertise?</p><figure data-orig-width="361" data-orig-height="640" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/img/2017-10-24-advertisement-for-the-army/3f19a48c9630ee4b60c84e74dd01fb0359f93168c1424961459ecb65e73152ba.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="361" data-orig-height="640"></figure>
