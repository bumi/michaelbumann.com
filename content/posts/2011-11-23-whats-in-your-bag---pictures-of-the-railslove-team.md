title: "What's in your bag? - Pictures of the Railslove Team"
---
<p>Fellow Railslover <a href="http://twitter.com/wakkahari">Paul</a> is currently taking pictures of the whole team. For that he also asked everyone to show what's in our bags and took pictures of the belongings. </p>&#13;
<p>I really love the results. What are the pictures telling about the people? ;) </p>&#13;
