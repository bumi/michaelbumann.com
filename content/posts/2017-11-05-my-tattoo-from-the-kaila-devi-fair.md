title: "My tattoo from the Kaila devi fair"
---
<p>Earlier this year I’ve been in SE Asia and while visiting Myanmar/Burma my good friend Puneet told me he will visit his mother in India. As I was thinking about moving to India after Myanmar anyway I was excited about the chance to meet him and his mother there!&nbsp;<br></p><p>I really like all the places I’ve seen in India so far and it has been great again!&nbsp;<br>Puneet now wrote on his <a href="http://bharill.com/">blog</a>&nbsp;about <a href="http://bharill.com/post/167103297011/rashmirohitrajasthan">our visit at the Kaila devi fair</a>&nbsp;where we ended up getting the most beautiful tattoos ever!</p><p>I never thought I ever will get a tattoo - something that will be there forever?! - on a small village fair in the middle of nowhere it happened. I enjoyed the fair a lot and I got excited about the tattoo artists... so it happened I got a small, beautiful, ugly memory of that time and the fair :)&nbsp;</p><p><b><a href="http://bharill.com/post/167103297011/rashmirohitrajasthan">Read the full story on Puneet’s blog... check it out also for pictures and details about the fair.&nbsp;</a></b></p><p>...and there are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=16946748%40N00&amp;sort=date-taken-desc&amp;text=kaila%20devi&amp;view_all=1">some photos on my flickr stream</a>.</p><figure data-orig-width="2016" data-orig-height="1512" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/img/2017-11-05-my-tattoo-from-the-kaila-devi-fair/668f1bfb41d54ab955c205698984f6d861538d192be1aa623ea16e531c3f542c.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2016" data-orig-height="1512"></figure><figure data-orig-width="2016" data-orig-height="1512" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/img/2017-11-05-my-tattoo-from-the-kaila-devi-fair/9ecf24b584d748c42fbe8a9d3ef76a8cfbc675e37143293608aca9276300d265.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2016" data-orig-height="1512"></figure><figure data-orig-width="768" data-orig-height="1024" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/img/2017-11-05-my-tattoo-from-the-kaila-devi-fair/9c5204e3d7ff8b5565d559b7a5d492de2ebddb4947bdc61560bd40048e9d6f6c.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="768" data-orig-height="1024"></figure>
